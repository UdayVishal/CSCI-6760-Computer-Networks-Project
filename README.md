# CSCI-6760-Computer-Networks-Project

This project is about implementation of traceroute, which is a command line tool which is used to track the path of packet from source to destination across a network. This is achieved by sending multiple packets and analyzing the error messages received from each router on the way using the ICMP protocol.
